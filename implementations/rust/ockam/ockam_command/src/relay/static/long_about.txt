In various network environments prioritizing security and restricted access, relays play a vital role as intermediaries. They facilitate secure communication between entities without the need for direct connections, ensuring servers providing critical services remain shielded from direct external access in enterprise environments. Home devices, such as smart appliances or security systems, can communicate securely with external services through relays, avoiding vulnerabilities associated with directly opening ports. Similarly, in operational technology (OT) networks, relays enable robust and secure communication, safeguarding sensitive industrial systems from potential threats.

Relays make it possible to establish end-to-end protocols with services operating in a remote private networks, without requiring a remote service to expose listening ports to an outside hostile network like the Internet.
